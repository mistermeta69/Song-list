Theres no point in asking us youll get no reply
Oh just remenber a dont decide
I got no reason its all too much
Youll always find us
Out to lunch !

Oh were so pretty oh so pretty vacant
But now and we dont care

Dont ask us to attend cos were not all there
Oh dont pretend cos I dont care
I dont believe illusions cos too much is real
So stop your cheap comment
Cos we know what we feel

Were pretty pretty vacant
Were pretty pretty vay-cunt
And we dont care
