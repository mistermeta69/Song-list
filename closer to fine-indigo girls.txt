  Officially, capo 2, but who does?]

I'm trying to tell you something 'bout my life
Maybe give me insight between black and white
And the best thing you've ever done for me
Is to help me take my life less seriously
It's only life after all, yeah

/ G G6 C(9) D* / / D11 - C - / / 1st /

Well darkness has a hunger that's insatiable
And lightness has a call that's hard to hear
I wrap my fear around me like a blanket
I sailed my ship of safety till I sank it
I'm crawling on your shore

/ G G6 C(9) D* / / D11 - C - / / / G C(9)G /

{Refrain}
I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains
I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain
There's more than one answer to these questions
Pointing me in a crooked line
And the less I seek my source for some definitive
   The less I seek my source
Closer I am to fine
Closer I am to fine

/ D - C(9) G / / D11 - C - / G C(9)G / 
     / D11 - C - / G G6 C(9) D* / /

And I went to see the doctor of philosophy
With a poster of Rasputin and a beard down to his knee
He never did marry or see a B-grade movie
He graded my performance, he said he could see through me
I spent four years prostrate to the higher mind
Got my paper and I was free

{Refrain}

I stopped by the bar at 3 a.m.
To seek solace in a bottle or possibly a friend
I woke up with a headache like my head against a board
Twice as cloudy as I'd been the night before
And I went in seeking clarity

I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains
I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain
We go to the doctor, we go to the mountains
We look to the children, we drink from the fountain
Yeah, we go to the bible, we go through the workout
We read up on revival and we stand up for the lookout

There's more than one answer to these questions
Pointing me in a crooked line
The less I seek my source for some definitive
   The less I seek my source
Closer I am to fine
Closer I am to fine
Closer I am to fine
