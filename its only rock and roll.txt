It's Only Rock 'N' Roll - The Rolling Stones (1974)
     
     E
     If I could stick my pen in my heart
     and would spill it all over the stage
     Would it satisfy ya, would it slide on by ya,
     Would you think the boy is strange?
              A  G  E
     Ain't he strange?
     
     E
     If I could win ya, If I could sing ya
     a love song so divine
     would it be enough for your cheating heart
     if I broke down and cried?
          A G E
     If I cried?
     
          CHORUS
                 A                                        E
          I said I know... it's only rock and roll, but I like it
          A
          I know... it's only rock and roll,
                E        D        A     E
          but I like it, like it, yes I do
                  A
          Oh well I like it 
            E
          I like it
            A
          I like it
                 D         A
          I said can't you see
               D        A              E
          that this old boy has been a-lonely
     
     E
     If I could stick a knife in my heart
     Suicide right on the stage
     Would it be enough for your teenage lust
     Would it help to ease the pain?
               A G E
     Ease your brain?
     
     E
     If I could dig down deep in my heart
     Feelings would flood on the page
     Would it satisfy ya, would it slide on by ya,
     Would you think the boy's insane?
          A G E
     He's insane
     
     CHORUS, repeating to fade


It's Only Rock 'N Roll (But I Like It)
   ------The Rolling Stones

(M. Jagger/K. Richards)

If I could stick my pen in my heart
And spill it all over the stage
Would it satisfy ya, would it slide on by ya
Would you think the boy is strange? Ain't he strange?

If I could win ya, if I could sing ya
A love song so divine
Would it be enough for your cheating heart
If I broke down and cried? If I cried?

I said I know it's only rock 'n roll but I like it
I know it's only rock 'n roll but I like it, like it, yes, I do
Oh, well, I like it, I like it, I like it
I said can't you see that this old boy has been a lonely?

If I could stick a knife in my heart
Suicide right on stage
Would it be enough for your teenage lust
Would it help to ease the pain? Ease your brain?

If I could dig down deep in my heart
Feelings would flood on the page
Would it satisfy ya, would it slide on by ya
Would ya think the boy's insane? He's insane

I said I know it's only rock 'n roll but I like it
I said I know it's only rock'n roll but I like it, like it, yes, I do
Oh, well, I like it, I like it, I like it
I said can't you see that this old boy has been a lonely?

And do ya think that you're the only girl around?
I bet you think that you're the only woman in town

I said I know it's only rock 'n roll but I like it
I said I know it's only rock 'n roll but I like it
I said I know it's only rock 'n roll but I like it, like it, yes, I do
Oh, well, I like it, I like it. I like it...
